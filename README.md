# Computer-Aided Diagnosis System for Early Breast Cancer Detection

## Overview

The **Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) System for Early Breast Cancer Detection** is an innovative project aimed at leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques to assist healthcare professionals in detecting breast cancer at an early stage. This system uses medical imaging data to automatically analyze mammograms and other diagnostic images, identifying potential signs of breast cancer. By automating this process, the system helps increase diagnostic accuracy, reduce human error, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Efficient preprocessing of mammogram images to enhance quality and remove noise.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilization of advanced techniques to extract relevant features from medical images.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms to classify mammograms as benign or malignant.
- **Early Detection**: Aimed at identifying early signs of breast cancer for timely intervention.
- **Visualization**: User-friendly visualizations to present results and diagnostics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for implementing algorithms and models.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Deep learning frameworks used for building and training models.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for traditional machine learning models and data preprocessing.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and feature extraction from medical images.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for presenting results.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing and testing code in an interactive environment.
 ## Dataset
The project uses publicly available datasets like:

Mammogram Images Dataset: Collected from various medical sources, such as the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM).
Ensure you comply with the data usage policies when using these datasets.

## Results
The system achieves significant accuracy in classifying mammogram images as benign or malignant. The trained models have demonstrated the potential to assist in early breast cancer detection with high precision, minimizing false positives and false negatives.
